To implement the user registration and user details fetch endpoints for a RESTful API using Spring Boot, you can follow the steps outlined below.
Create a new Spring Boot project:
Use the Spring Initializr (start.spring.io) to generate a new Spring Boot project.
Select the necessary dependencies, such as Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, and H2 Database (or any other database of your choice).
Download the project and import it into your preferred IDE.
Define the User entity:
Create a User class with attributes like id, username, email, and password.
Annotate the class with @Entity to mark it as a JPA entity.
Define the necessary getters and setters for the attributes.
Implement the user registration endpoint:
Create a UserController class with a method to handle the registration request.
Annotate the method with @PostMapping("/api/user/register") to map it to the appropriate endpoint.
Use the @RequestBody annotation to bind the request body to the User object.
Implement the logic to store the user's information securely in the database or any other storage mechanism of your choice.
Return appropriate responses to indicate the success or failure of the registration process.
Implement the user details fetch endpoint:
Create another method in the UserController class to handle the fetch request.
Annotate the method with @GetMapping("/api/user/fetch") to map it to the appropriate endpoint.
Use the @RequestParam annotation to bind the query parameter username to a method parameter.
Implement the logic to fetch the user's information securely from the database or any other storage mechanism of your choice.
Return appropriate responses to indicate the success or failure of the user fetch process.
Implement exception handling and security best practices:
Implement proper exception handling in your application to handle errors gracefully.
Use security best practices to protect sensitive user data and prevent potential vulnerabilities. This may include implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms, encrypting passwords, and validating user input.
Write unit tests (optional):
Write unit tests to ensure the correct behavior of the registration endpoint.
Use testing frameworks like JUnit and Mockito to write comprehensive tests for your application.
Document the API (optional):
Use Swagger or an alternate documentation tool to document your API.
Document the endpoints, request/response formats, and any additional information that may be useful for API consumers.
Run the application:
Build and run the Spring Boot application.
Test the endpoints using tools like curl, Postman, or a web browser.
Submit your solution:
Create a new public repository on GitHub.
Commit your solution code to the repository.
Update the README file with instructions on how to run the application and any other relevant information.
Share the repository URL with the assessors.
Please note that the above steps provide a high-level overview of the solution. You may need to refer to the official Spring Boot documentation and other online resources for detailed implementation guidance.
